<h2>New to Magento? Need some help?</h2>
If you're not sure about the following, you probably need a little help before you start installing the Bannerslider extension:

*	What's a <a href="http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/install-gde/basics/basics_login.html">terminal, command prompt, or Secure Shell (ssh)</a>?
*	Where's my <a href="http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/install-gde/basics/basics_login.html">Magento server</a> and how do I access it?

<h2>Step 1: Verify your prerequisites</h2>

Use the following table to verify you have the correct prerequisites to install the Magento software.

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Prerequisite</th>
			<th>How to check</th>
			<th>For more information</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Magento version Community Edition 2.0</td>
			<td>Go to admin page, you can see version of magento 2 at left bottom page, </td>
			<td>Download Magento version Community Edition 2.0 at <a href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/download">here</a></td>
		</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Step 2: Pre-Installation</h2>
The Magento front end relies heavily on caching to provide a faster experience to customer. This is a wonderful tool, but can wreak havoc during the installation process. To ensure that the cache is not the cause of any problems, we should turn it off. This can be done from the admin console by navigating to the cache management page (System->Cache Management), selecting all caches, clicking ‘disable’ from the drop-down menu, and submitting the change.

<h2>Step 3: Install and verify the installation</h2>
